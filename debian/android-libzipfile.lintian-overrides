# These shlibs are stuck into /usr/lib/android because they are only meant to
# be used with Android utilities and they need to be built as one big package,
# so that everything is on the exact same version.  They are registered as
# shlibs so that dh_shlibsdeps will automatically dependency generation.
# These libraries should never be used by other projects since they have no
# upstream standalone releases or versioning.
